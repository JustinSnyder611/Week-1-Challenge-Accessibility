# <Week-1-Challenge-Accessibility>

## Description

For Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. I wanted to make the website more accessible so that if someone who has problems seeing could be able to access their and sight and understand everything on the page.
Fixing this code I learned that writing code organized not only helps the website run better but helps you diagnose problems at a later stage. I also learned that makeing my websites accessible increases the amount of people viewing my site.

## Installation

To view the website on GitHub:
1. Click Settings
2. Click Pages on the right hand side of the page
3. Then click Vist Site

## Usage

The only way to interact with the webpage is to click the links "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management",and "Social Media Marketing" at the top right of the page to go deeper into the page.

I used this to help me learn good semantics.
